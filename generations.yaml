    description: "The Peugeot 308 Hybrid represents the plug-in hybrid variant of the third-generation 308, built on the EMP2 V3 platform specifically optimized for electrification. Available in both five-door hatchback and SW (station wagon) body styles, it features identical exterior styling to conventional 308 models with subtle Hybrid badging, distinctive 'fang' LED daytime running lights, and the new Peugeot emblem prominently displayed on its bold grille. Offered in two power levels: Hybrid 180 combining a 150 hp 1.6-liter PureTech turbocharged gasoline engine with an 81 kW electric motor for a combined 180 horsepower, and Hybrid 225 with an uprated 180 hp gasoline engine for a total system output of 225 horsepower. Both versions utilize the same 12.4 kWh lithium-ion battery providing approximately 37 miles (60 km) of electric-only range under WLTP testing. The powertrain is paired with an e-EAT8 eight-speed automatic transmission with the electric motor integrated into the gearbox. The interior features Peugeot's latest i-Cockpit design with a 10-inch digital instrument cluster, 10-inch central touchscreen with customizable i-toggle shortcut buttons, and compact steering wheel positioned below the instruments. Dedicated hybrid system displays show energy flow, battery status, and charging information. Driving modes include Electric, Hybrid, and Sport, with a specific 'e-Save' function to preserve battery charge for later use. Charging capabilities include support for up to 7.4 kW AC charging, allowing a full charge in under 2 hours. Despite the addition of hybrid components, clever packaging minimizes the impact on interior space, with only a slight reduction in cargo capacity compared to conventional models. The 308 Hybrid maintains the model's focus on distinctive design, driving engagement, and premium feel while adding significant efficiency benefits and electric driving capability."
